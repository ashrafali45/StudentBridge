# Design Doc v1

## 1) Project purpose
**One-sentence summary:**
StudentBridge is a web platform that connects international students with local part-time job opportunities and allows business owners to hire and manage workers easily.

**Why this matters:**
Students in foreign countries struggle to find trusted part-time jobs, while business owners need reliable workers. This system bridges the gap between them.

---

## 2) Target users
- **Primary user:**
  International Students

- **Secondary user:**
  Business Owner / Employer

- **What they need:**

  **Students need:**
  - Search nearby part-time jobs
  - Apply easily
  - Track application status
  - View job details (salary, time, location)

  **Business Owners need:**
  - Post job openings
  - View student applications
  - Select and manage employees
  - Track worker performance

---

## 3) MVP scope

### In scope now
- User registration & login (Student / Owner)
- Job posting system (Owner)
- Job search & apply (Student)
- Dashboard for both users
- Application tracking system
- Basic notification system

### Out of scope for now

---

## 4) Core user flow

1. Student signs up and logs in
2. Student searches for part-time jobs
3. Student applies for a job
4. Business owner reviews applications
5. Owner selects student and assigns work

---
